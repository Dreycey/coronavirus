## Description.

This work contains the scripts and code used to look at nextstrain results. The
output of nextstrain was used to perform different analyses on the COVID-19
genomes. The following was performed: 

(1) Obtain list of mutations, along with frequency of each. 
(2) Obtain a timeline for each.
(3) find if similiar mutations happen in seperate events, such as different
times, and/or different locations.
